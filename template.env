# THIS IS A TEMPLATE .env FILE. 
# MAKE A COPY OF THIS FILE NAMED .env, AND THEN MODIFY THE VALUES AS NEEDED.
#
# Tip: To verify your changes to the .env have taken effect, run the command: docker compose config
# For more information on each environment variable, see the Neurobagel documentation.

# ---- PROJECT NAME ----
# Controls the base name of the docker compose services when launched.
# Replace neurobagel_node with an informative name based on your data and/or deployment profile
# This is optional but will be used to group together your Neurobagel Docker containers in the list of running containers (i.e., `docker ps`), 
# making them easier to identify if you need to run multiple Neurobagel service stacks on different ports.
#
# e.g., If you wish to deploy the local_node profile to set up a local Neurobagel node for the ABIDE database, 
# and the local_federation profile to also set up local federation,
# you could set COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=abide and COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=federation, respectively, in the .env file for each recipe.
#
# Note: Must not include any spaces or uppercase letters.
COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=neurobagel_node

# ---- CONFIGURATION FOR graph ----
# Replace DBUSER with the username you want to set for your graph database user
NB_GRAPH_USERNAME=DBUSER
# Replace my_db with the name you want to give your graph database
NB_GRAPH_DB=repositories/my_db
# Replace ./data with the path to your JSONLD files
LOCAL_GRAPH_DATA=./data

# Additional configurable parameters - uncomment to change the defaults
# Change NB_GRAPH_PORT_HOST if port 7200 is already in use on the machine
# NB_GRAPH_PORT_HOST=7200
# Replace ./secrets with the directory path containing the text files with your desired 
# secure passwords for GraphDB (NB_GRAPH_ADMIN_PASSWORD.txt and NB_GRAPH_PASSWORD.txt)
# NB_GRAPH_SECRETS_PATH=./secrets
# ---------------------------------

# ---- CONFIGURATION FOR n-API ----
# Whether to return only aggregate, dataset-level query results (excluding subject/session-level attributes).
NB_RETURN_AGG=true

# Additional configurable parameters - uncomment to change the defaults
# If using a reverse proxy (NGINX, Caddy, etc.): change NB_NAPI_BASE_PATH if your proxy serves the n-API from a specific non-root path. 
# e.g., if your proxy is configured to have mynode.org/napi point to the n-API, set NB_NAPI_BASE_PATH="/napi"
# Do not include a trailing slash!
# NB_NAPI_BASE_PATH=""
# Change NB_NAPI_PORT_HOST if port 8000 is already in use on the machine
# NB_NAPI_PORT_HOST=8000
# Minimum number of matching subjects required for a dataset to be returned as a query match. Datasets with matching subjects <= this number will be excluded from query results.
# NB_MIN_CELL_SIZE=0
# Origins to allow requests from. To limit to specific origins, replace * with URLs separated by a space.
# NB_NAPI_ALLOWED_ORIGINS="*"
# NB_NAPI_TAG=latest
# ---------------------------------

# ---- CONFIGURATION FOR f-API ----
# Additional configurable parameters - uncomment to change the defaults
# If using a reverse proxy (NGINX, Caddy, etc.): change NB_FAPI_BASE_PATH if your proxy serves the f-API from a specific non-root path. 
# e.g., if your proxy is configured to have mynode.org/fapi point to the f-API, set NB_FAPI_BASE_PATH="/fapi"
# Do not include a trailing slash!
# NB_FAPI_BASE_PATH=""
# Change NB_FAPI_PORT_HOST if port 8080 is already in use on the machine
# NB_FAPI_PORT_HOST=8080
# NB_FAPI_TAG=latest
# NB_FEDERATE_REMOTE_PUBLIC_NODES=True
# ---------------------------------

# ---- CONFIGURATION FOR QUERY TOOL ----
# You MUST replace http://XX.XX.XX.XX with the URL (and port, if needed) of the Neurobagel f-API the query tool should send requests to.
# The query tool sends requests from a user's machine, so ensure you provide the URL of the f-API *as a user would access it from their own (external) machine*, 
# even if the query tool and the Neurobagel f-API are hosted on the same physical machine.
# e.g., https://neurobagel.myInstitute.edu/federation
#
# Exception: If you are testing your setup locally and will only access the query tool from the SAME machine 
# that your f-API is hosted on, you can use localhost as the URL.
# e.g., http://localhost:8080 (if NB_FAPI_PORT_HOST=8080):
NB_API_QUERY_URL=http://XX.XX.XX.XX

# Additional configurable parameters - uncomment to change the defaults
# If using a reverse proxy (NGINX, Caddy, etc.): change NB_QUERY_APP_BASE_PATH if your proxy serves the query tool from a specific non-root path. 
# e.g., if your proxy is configured to have mynode.org/querytool point to the query tool, set NB_QUERY_APP_BASE_PATH=/querytool
# NB_QUERY_APP_BASE_PATH=/
# Change NB_QUERY_PORT_HOST if port 3000 is already in use on the machine
# NB_QUERY_PORT_HOST=3000
# NB_QUERY_TAG=latest
# --------------------------------------

# ---- EXPERIMENTAL FEATURES ----
# IMPORTANT: THE BELOW SETTINGS ARE EXPERIMENTAL AND SHOULD NOT BE MODIFIED EXCEPT IN DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENTS.

# The below two settings are used by both the query tool and the f-API.
# NB_ENABLE_AUTH=false
# If NB_ENABLE_AUTH is set to true, you MUST provide a valid OAuth client ID for your query tool instance.
# To obtain an OAuth client ID to enable login with Google, see https://developers.google.com/identity/openid-connect/openid-connect#appsetup.
# NB_QUERY_CLIENT_ID=XXXX

# NB_QUERY_HEADER_SCRIPT=""
# --------------------------------

# ---- CONFIGURATION FOR docker compose ----
# Default service profile (deployment "flavour") for `docker compose` command
COMPOSE_PROFILES=full_stack
# ------------------------------------------
